# Movie-Genre-Classification
<h2>the first task of the Machine Learning internship at <B>CodSoft</B>.</h4>
<p>It's called: <b>Movies Genre ClassificationðŸ“½ðŸŽ¬</b>
The task involves predicting the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.</p>
<ul>
<h3>Techniques used:</h3>
<li>I employed a TF-IDF vectorizer technique on the files Train_data.txt and test_data.txt to convert them into CSV files for use with the classification model.
</li>
<li>I utilized a classification model called Naive Bayes Technique.
</li>
<li>Finally, I employed various methods and techniques to improve the accuracy score, including cross-validation with different values of alpha.
</li>
